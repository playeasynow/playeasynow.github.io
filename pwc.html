                    Out of undergrad, I moved to San Francisco and started my professional career with PwC <a href="https://www.pwc.com/"
                        class="link">(PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP)</a>. I studied Marketing in school
                    and I knew I wanted to work in the technology industry, so I asked the firm to place me on projects
                    that were relevant and challenging.
                    I had new projects every 6 to 10 months over the years, from marketing lifecycle automation
                    projects, to customer experience and user design strategy,
                    to a Salesforce implementation as part of the Business Architecture and Change Management teams.

                            on was to give each of my assignments a higher purpose and truly solve problems for myself.
