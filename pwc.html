                    Out of undergrad, I moved to San Francisco and started my professional career with PwC <a href="https://www.pwc.com/"
                        class="link" target="_blank">(PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP)</a>. I studied Marketing
                    and knew I wanted to work in the technology industry, so I interviewed for projects
                    that were relevant and challenging.
                    As a management consultant, I often worked with business and technical teams to deliver services in
                    ecommerce, marketing and sales operations, training and even risk management.

                                    BXT stands for business, experience and technology. PwC began a firmwide initiative
                                    in 2017 to bring
                                    design thinking, agile practices, and analytics to staff, while modernizing our
                                    delivery approach
                                    by building cross-functional teams and tackling broader scope in our services. On a
                                    tour of duty, I joined the team to contribute my change management
                                    and design thinking experience. <br>
