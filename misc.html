                                When I first moved to San Francisco in 2014, I lived with 23 other people in a 4-story
                                home. We were part of an
                                organization that wanted to make community-style living a reality for people in SF and
                                across the country. I learned
                                so much about the benefits of sharing and building communal spaces: idea and skills
                                sharing, continuous cultural exchange,
                                and the reminder that everyone is unique and deserves respect. From this, I realized, I
                                wanted to create not necessarily a
                                living community space, but a public community space reaping the benefits minus the
                                sharing of olive oil and house chores.

                                peace, justice and human rights. We performed at the de Young Fine Arts Museum in San
                                Francisco in December of 2017,
                                to an audience of over 200 attendees. Additionally, the chorus has performed at the
                                Women's March in SF in January of 2018 and other community events
                                when possible.

                                    Soon after I moved to SF, I met Seamus Berkeley, an artist and painter, in a Lyft (he was my driver!). He told me about his

                                    He wanted to memorialize the staff, as well as, illustrate the various emotions families experienced while there. <br>
