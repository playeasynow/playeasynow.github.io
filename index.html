        <div id="aboutText">
            <p>An interesting paradox in my life is that my greatest strength and weakness are the same: <span>my ability to adapt to any given environment</span>. It's a strength of mine because I have been able to sustain a bi-cultural lifestyle fluidly, live and build community in a variety of places around the world, and continue to learn even when no one is teaching. It is also a weakness in that I often find myself thirsting for change every few months.</p>
            <p>I will pull from the range of my experiences and use empathy to build beautiful software services. That often requires a team, and <span>I know I can lead,</span> or co-lead many teams. I will spend time to really get to know the problem at hand to establish a north star anyone can follow.</p>
            <p>I'm from Texas, so you know my heart is big. I've also lived in <span>San Francisco, Tokyo and Madrid</span>, so would love to chat about your travel interests before we get started. &#9786; <br> Visit my contact page up top to get connected!</p>
