Welcome to my Github repository! I am currently using this repo to host my portfolio on Github Pages. All of my work created during the web development certification is under this master repository. Easy right? :) 

# Design Idea
The design of my site was inspired by a software product designer I follow, Ethan Stuart. I recognized, though I love complex and dazzling front-end designs, I needed to make my portfolio easy-to-read, concise and informative. Hope you like it!
